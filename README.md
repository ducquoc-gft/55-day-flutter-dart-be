==========

Learning journey with Flutter framework and Dart programming language - mostly for mobile app cross platforms (Android/iOS).

Originally investigated in 2018, revisited in 2023.

### Usage

**Basic Usage**

Given already installed Flutter SDK (and set FLUTTER_HOME), check with flutter doctor
```sh
  $ cd testdrive
  $ flutter doctor
```

### Samples

Update dependencies and build (if already has AndroidSDK+Emulator or XCode+Simulator), may take 2-4 GB disk space.
```sh
  $ flutter pub get
  $ flutter build apk || dart run build_runner build
```

#### Running samples

Run and test
```bash
  $ flutter run
  $ flutter test --coverage
```

Likewise, you can run with the other platform, or run other examples in root directory.
